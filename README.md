# Week-9-Test

**Name at least two things to check for debugging for when your code isn’t working (bonus points for more then two).**

Link to "lib/wow.js" or link to "lib/app.js".
Use dollar signs and parenthesis.
Check for semicolon.


**Why won’t this work? In your HTML: `<input class=”.some-element” type=“text” />` In your Javascript: `$(“.another-element”).val();`**

Same element and another element need to share the same name, and one shows type=text, the other shows val().


**What’s the relationship between JavaScript and jQuery?**

jquery is javascript simplified with fewer lines of code.


**What does `var name = $(‘.name-field’).val();` do?**

Creates a text box where you can provide your name.




**How do we make sure an element is hidden when the page is first loaded? Hint: you don’t need any javascript! How do we then unhide that element using javascript?**

Hide by using display:none. Unhide when the alert is clicked.


**What’s the difference between `$(‘#myElement’)` and `$(‘.myElement’)`?**

The # shows it is an ID which selects an element, the . is a class.
